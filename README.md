The bot responsible for removing user access

## Roadmap
### discipline bot
This bot. There are a lot of TODOs in [the code](discipline_bot.py) you could contribute! We could pay you too!

### redeem bot
If anyone makes a donation and they do not have the Active role
    give them the role such that they have the full access to all channels

Other potential ways of redemption. One example might be consecutively doing problems on time for 5 days.

### (later) leaderboard bot
Similar to streak Timecounter https://github.com/Study-Together-Org/time_counter
